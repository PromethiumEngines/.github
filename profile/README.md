<h2 align="center">Organization dedicated to build "engines" to simulate certain games</h2>

Why?
Short story, I was bored and decided to make something to simulate a game of my favorite <i>board</i> games and then he created "engines" to simulate various famous <i>board</i> games.

<br/>

Engines made by us:

|                                    Engine                                     |                   Description                    | Status | NodeJS |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------: | :----: | :----: |
| [Yu-Gi-Oh! Engine](https://github.com/PromethiumEngines/yugioh-battle-engine) | An engine to simulate a card duel of "Yu-Gi-Oh!" |   🚧   |   ❌   |
|       [Catan Engine](https://github.com/PromethiumEngines/catan-engine)       |  An engine made to simulate a game of "Catan".   |   🚧   |   ❌   |
|   [TicTacToe Engine](https://github.com/PromethiumEngines/tictactoe-engine)   |   An engine to simulate a game of "TicTacToe"    |   ✅   |   ❌   |

✅: Finished<br/>
🚧: Work in Progress<br/>
❌: Discontinued/Not planned<br/>
<i>All of these engines are a GoLang package, its planned to do a NodeJS package for each engine</i>
